# Anisotropic Diffusive Equation MATLAB functions

A collection of utility functions to returning solutions to the Anisotropic Diffusive Equation (ADE) in different scattering regimes (steady-state, time-resolved, time- and space-resolved).
This package is given as a supplemental material of a preprint paper on Anisotropic Diffusion.
Note that with respect to the preprint, these functions extend the solutions to the case of complete 3D anisotropy (lx!=ly!=lz). This is achieved via numerical evaluation of integrals, instead of explicit analytical solutions.

If you find it interesting and you used it, please cite the preprint.
