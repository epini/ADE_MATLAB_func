# Anisotropic Diffusive Equation MATLAB functions

A collection of utility functions returning solutions to the Anisotropic Diffusive Equation (ADE) in a scattering slab for different configurations (time- and/or space-resolved reflectance/transmittance).

This repository is provided as a supplement to our work on "Diffusion of light in structurally anisotropic media with uniaxial symmetry", DOI: [10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.023051](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.023051)

In addition to the uniaxial-symmetric case described in the paper, the functions provide the ADE solution also for the case of complete 3D anisotropy ($`\ell_x \neq \ell_y \neq \ell_z`$) following a numerical integration scheme.
