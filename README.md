# Anisotropic Diffusive Equation MATLAB functions

A collection of utility functions returning solutions to the Anisotropic Diffusive Equation (ADE) in a scattering slab for different configurations (time- and/or space-resolved reflectance/transmittance).
The slab is indefinitively extended in the xy plane, while z is the beam direction of incidence.
A series of test files are provided for different kinds of measurements.

This repository is provided as a supplement to our work on "Diffusion of light in structurally anisotropic media with uniaxial symmetry", DOI: [10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.023051](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.023051)

In addition to the uniaxial-symmetric case described in the paper, following a numerical integration scheme the functions provide the ADE solution for the more general case of complete 3D anisotropy ($`\ell_x \neq \ell_y \neq \ell_z`$), mismatch refractive index at the boundaries and homogeneous absorption.
